# 身分識別交叉對照表

{{limited-availability-release-note}}

Learn all about identity crosswalks in Real-Time CDP Collaboration, including how to bring identity crosswalks in from different sources, and how to manage identity crosswalks.

Identity crosswalks facilitate the secure and privacy-compliant linking of customer identities across multiple datasets and platforms. By utilizing hashed identifiers, Real-Time CDP Collaboration ensures that users can synchronize and reconcile identities without exposing personal identifiable information (PII). This enables a unified view of the customer for better collaboration and targeted marketing efforts.

As a first step, you must import identity crosswalks into Real-Time CDP Collaboration. To import identity crosswalks into Real-Time CDP Collaboration, read the section below:
